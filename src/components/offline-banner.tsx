// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses variables named 'brevity', 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without declaration or import.
// To fix this, I will declare these variables with a default value of `undefined`.
// This is a placeholder solution. A proper fix would involve understanding the intended use of these variables
// and either importing them from a relevant module or initializing them with appropriate values.
